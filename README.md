# Tabu Search
#### implementation of the tabu search algorithm in [SystemC]
####
####
## Description :
- Tabu List
The recently searched answers are placed in the tabu list to avoid local optimal answers

- Search Method
Inside this function, the main process of this algorithm is implemented, which first creates a number of solutions randomly and continues until the final condition of the algorithm is reached.

- Find Neighbors Method
By taking a solution at the input, it finds its neighbors for checking

- Make Solutions Method
This function creates a number of solutions randomly

- Make Output Method
If the condition is met, it sets the output of the algorithm

- Check Final Method
It checks the conditions for the end of the algorithm process to determine if the final answer is established

- Check Solution Method
By taking a solution in the input, calculates the solution value according to the information of the problem
